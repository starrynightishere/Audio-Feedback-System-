# Audio-to-Audio Feedback System

## Overview

The Audio-to-Audio Feedback System is an innovative application designed to convert spoken audio into text, correct grammatical errors, and provide users with audio feedback of the corrected text. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance speech recognition and grammar correction, delivering a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for the implementation.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For speech recognition.
- **Gramformer**: For grammar correction.
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: For generating audio feedback.
- **PyTorch**: Backend for model training and inference.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

git clone https://github.com/starrynightishere/Audio-Feedback-System
cd https://github.com/starrynightishere/Audio-Feedback-System

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Gramformer
- gTTS

## Usage

1. Place your audio files in the designated input folder.
2. Run the script to process the audio files and generate feedback:
3. Listen to the output audio feedback, which will contain the corrected speech.
